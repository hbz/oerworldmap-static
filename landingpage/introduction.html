<h2>The OER World Map</h2>

<p>
  Our goal is to provide the most complete and comprehensible picture of the global Open Educational Resources (OER) movement. Information is collected on people, organizations, services, projects and events related to OER and Open Education.
</p>

<p>
  Building the map is a collaborative process. You can contribute!
